Questions

1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?
- It is because they are designed that way. Developers disabled
autoplay in order to protect the user's bandwidth.
2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is
browsing on a device with 320 x 568 resolution?
- The only screen means it will apply css style to a device only with
a screen. When it a used a device with 320 x 568 resolution and the @media
is sat to have a min-device-width of 768px, that means the media-file will
not be displayed.
3. Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website
instead of dedicated versions like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?
- Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.
By having a single responsive website it will be more easy for the designer
to know where everything is, and in that way it will be easier to change
later than to have to change in the more dedicated versions aswell.
