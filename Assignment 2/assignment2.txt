1. Inline style CSS override rules defined in style elements and external
stylesheets (sidenote: if the !important is used, that will overrule).
But inline style CSS override the rest because it is made that way. It is
though a natural explanation. It is easier to edit in the inline style CSS if
a problem appears and a small change need to take place, it is much easier
to do it that way.

2. ID vil overrule classes, so if we want to have a class but make it not count
 for one part, or make that part different, we can use ID. Classes makes it
 easier to change than to use a lot of id's.

 3. RGBA is the same as the RGB, but gives the possibility to choose how strong
 you want the RGB to be. RGB means red, green, blue and will, based on how high
numbers it is given, make different colors. The scale goes from 0-255.
The alpha (A) can be called the opacity of the color.

4. Because if you put css in the body element it can not be valid in strict
browsers like Firefox.
