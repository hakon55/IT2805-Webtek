1. Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in Javascript?
- JavaScript uses 64-bit floating point representation, which will represent numbers
as a whole number times a power of two. 0.1, which is a rational number, can't be
exactly represented. 0.2 and 0.3 will neither be their true values, so when we add
0.1 + 0.2 we will get a number disagreeing with the constant 0.3 in our code
2. What does the method attribute on a form element decide?
The method attribute decides how to send form-data. It can be sent as URL variables
(with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post")
3. Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element
is changed to GET?
- When GET is used it will append form-data into the URL in name/value pairs.
The length of a URL is limited to about 3000 characters.
4. Why is it considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5
and/or Javascript?
All browsers don't support HTML5's built in form validation. The form validation
with HTML and JavaScript is only validating in client-side, which means that a lot
of data inputs can be wrong or useless. Therefor we also need server side validation,
which is performed by a web server, after the input has been sent to the server.
5. When is it appropriate to use textarea over input?
- The textarea tag defines a multi-line text input control. It can hold unlimited
numbers of carachters, which makes it appropriate to use if it is a lot of
text that need to be appended.
