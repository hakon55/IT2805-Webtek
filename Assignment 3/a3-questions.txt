Questions:
1) The difference between position: absolute and position: fixed is that
absolute will be positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. The
fixed is positioned relative to the viewport, so whenever fixed is used it
will always stay the same page even when the page is scrolled.
2) We can use the pseudo-selector called the nth-child.
